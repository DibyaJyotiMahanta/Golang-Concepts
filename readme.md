## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide practical examples and explanations of key Go programming concepts, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Error Handling
- Printing Functions
- Structs
- CRUD Operations
- Data Conversion
- Loops (`for`)
- Goroutines
- JSON Handling
- Maps
- Pointers
- Slices
- String Functions
- Switch Statements
- Time Manipulation

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific Go concept:

```plaintext
├── Array/
├── ErrorHandel/
├── Printf/
├── Struct/
├── crud/
├── dataCov/
├── for/
├── goroutines/
├── json/
├── map/
├── pointer/
├── slice/
├── stringFunctions/
├── switch/
├── time/
└── execute.go
```

Each directory contains Go files (`.go`) demonstrating the respective concept. The `execute.go` file serves as an entry point to execute various examples.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DibyaJyotiMahanta/Golang-Concepts.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Golang-Concepts
   ```

3. **Ensure you have Go installed:**

   - Download and install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

4. **Run the examples:**

   - You can run individual Go files using the `go run` command:

     ```bash
     go run Array/array_example.go
     ```

   - Alternatively, execute the `execute.go` file to run a specific example:

     ```bash
     go run execute.go
     ```

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify the code examples to deepen your understanding of Go concepts. Each directory contains self-contained examples that you can run and experiment with.
